# A Simple Integer Successor-Delete Data Structure

This folder contains the sources for the paper *A Simple Integer Successor-Delete Data Structure*, by Gerth St√∏lting Brodal, appearing in the proceedings of the [23rd Symposium on Experimental Algorithms (SEA 2025)](https://regindex.github.io/sea2025.github.io/).

The folder `code` contains the source code to generate the experimental plots contained in the paper. Running `code/successor-delete-evaluate.c` (compiled with GCC 14.2.0 using MSYS2 on Windows 11) required about 9 hours of computation time. Data gathered is saved in the file `data/data.csv`. Running `code/plot-figures.py` generates all the figures in the folder `plots`. The paper is [sea25.pdf](sea25.pdf).
